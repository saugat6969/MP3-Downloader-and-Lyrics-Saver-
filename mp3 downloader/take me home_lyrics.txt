40 ContributorsTake Me Home Lyrics[Verse 1]
Wrapped up, so consumed by all this hurt
If you ask me, don't know where to start
Anger, love, confusion, roads that go nowhere
I know there's somewhere better, 'cause you always take me there

[Pre-Chorus]
Came to you with a broken faith
Gave me more than a hand to hold
Caught before I hit the ground
Tell me I'm safe, you've got me now

[Chorus]
Would you take the wheel if I lose control?
If I'm lyin' here, will you take me home?
Could you take care of a broken soul?
Will you hold me now? Oh, will you take me home?
Oh, will you take me home?
Oh, will you take me home?
Oh, will you take me home?
Oh, will you take me home?
[Verse 2]
Hold the gun to my head, count 1, 2, 3
If it helps me walk away, then it's what I need
Every minute gets easier, the more you talk to me
You rationalize my darkest thoughts, yeah you, set them free

[Chorus]
Would you take the wheel if I lose control?
If I'm lyin' here, will you take me home?
Could you take care of a broken soul?
Will you hold me now? Oh, will you take me home?
Oh, will you take me home?
Oh, will you take me home?
Oh, will you take me home?
Oh, will you take me home?

[Bridge]
You say space will make it better and time will make it heal
I won't be lost forever and soon I wouldn't feel
Like I'm haunted, woah, falling
You say space will make it better and time will make it heal
I won't be lost forever and soon I wouldn't feel
Like I'm haunted, woah, falling
You say space will make it better and time will make it heal
I won't be lost forever and soon I wouldn't feel
Like I'm haunted, woah, falling
[Chorus]
Would you take the wheel if I lose control?
If I'm lyin' here, will you take me home?
Could you take care of a broken soul?
Will you hold me now? Oh, will you take me home?
Oh, will you take me home?
Oh, will you take me home?
Oh, will you take me home?
Oh, will you take me home?

[Outro]
